  <H1><center>A Brief Introduction</H1>
  <p>My name is Larissa but I general go by <b>Laz</b>. I'm twenty six years of age and live in the beautiful Lake Macquarie region with my wife, adopted brother and our kitten. Up until six months ago, I had spent the majority of my adult life working as a sous chef in upmarket local restaurants. Due to the physical degradation cause by spending fourteen hours on my feet every day, I chose to follow one of my other passions by venturing into the IT world.
  <br>
  <br>Currently I work for a major telecommunications provider, assisting in the resolution of difficulties on a nation wide government network; put simply I'm a complaints specialist.</p>

<p>In the words of Harlan Ellison: <i>“You are not entitled to your opinion. You are entitled to your informed opinion. No one is entitled to be ignorant.” </i>
<br>
<p>The 16 Personalities website theorises that only 0.8% of women fit into this class. This is an estimate of approximately 30.8 million women. In the grand scheme of things, this is not a large number. People who fit into this personality type are thought to be more goal orientated than their peers, great planners and often skilled in many fields. Unfortunately they are also often socially stunted, judgemental and unable to perform in highly structured environments.

Some people (or fictional characters) who also fit this personality type are Michelle Obama, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Yennefer of Vengerberg and Gandalf the Grey.

<h2>Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment</h2>

<img src="SPI 27.png" alt="SAPA"/>
</center>
<p> The <a href="https://sapa-project.org/info/faq.html#sapamean" target="_blank"> Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment</a>is designed to measure your abilities, temperament and interests. The responses you give are scored against twenty seven different indicators, comparing everything from creativity to authoritarianism. In conjunction with this, it also measures the Big Five scores and presents them on a bellgraph so that you can see yourself in comparison to the average. While this is quite an interesting way to break down the personality into tangible indivdual segments, I feel as though it could use some further refining.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>Having reviewed the results that these three tests provided, I do not feel as though anything particularly jaw dropping has been revealed. As a person I have always been somewhat turbulent and prone to anxiety, I didn't need a personality test to reveal that to me. However now that I've reviewed it with the consideration that it'll affect how my team performs, I will definitely aim to be clear and open with my peers. This will help to reduce any anxiety that may arise from fear of miscommunication or delay in setting concrete plans. It's definitely something that I will be mindful of when working with others.</p></p>

  <H1><center>Interest in IT</H1>
  <p><p>From the beginning of my childhood, I was obsessed with how and why things worked. At first it was things like bionicles or robotised Lego sets but eventually I discovered the internet and video games. As a twelve year old I ventured into the applications of mods for games like Unreal Tournament and Obivion, awed by the idea of being able to change a game however you wanted by simply coding it. As I got older I ventured into HTML coding for social website and watching documentries on groups like Anonymous and The Dark Overlord. Some of their accomplishments although nefarious are rather impressive. Personally I've always garnered more satisfaction from outsmarting people like that and solving puzzles.</p>
<p>
To date my experience in IT is limited to HTML coding, JavaScript and Network testing but I'm learning very quickly now that I've started my studies with RMIT and listening to Youtube videos during my work hours.</p>

<p>
I chose to join RMIT based upon the research I performed. My scope was resonably narrow given that I'm doing correspondence education but I did uncover a few interesting facts. For example, RMIT ranks 59th on the the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/our-education/reputation-and-rankings/reputation-and-rankings" target="_blank">Graduate Employment</a> which is pretty impressive considering how many people I know who have degrees but can't find a job in their field. The university has also consistently improved their <a href="https://www.mastersportal.com/rankings-reviews/11792/rmit-university.html" target="_blank">global ranking</a> in the last three years, moving forward over a hundred positions.
</p>

<p>
During my studies I hope to learn enough about coding and programming that I can help to make a difference. That's why I'm interested in pursuing cyber security, AI development or working in a company that does something similar to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/qvmm3x/hackers-hunting-missing-people-osint-defcon-tracelabs" target="_blank">TraceLabs</a> missing persons program.</p>

  <H1><center>My Dream Job</H1>
  <center><img src= "https://github.com/larissarmit/Assessment-One/blob/master/circuit.png?raw=true" "alt="Jobs" />
</center>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Working as a <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/40986652?type=standard#searchRequestToken=f52cdb3b-b275-4679-b22e-d2aa46ab16af" target="_blank">Software Engineer</a> in Machine Learning and AI is quite a incredulous goal. This role would involve working in a large group to a high standard, creating portions of code that are able to accept the boundaries of certain mechanics while still adapting to an ever changing external environment. As someone who has always been fascinated by puzzles, this seems to be the ultimate development puzzle. How do you plan to solve a problem that hasn't arisen yet? This having been said, this is not my dream job. My long term aspiration is to be involved in the development of artificial limbs or neuro-surgical implants.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Java / Python / R</li>
<li>Sprintboot / Django</li>
<li>Kotlin / Scala / Go</li>
<li>Angular / React</li>
<li>AWS or GCP</li>
<li>Some understanding of Computer Engineering and Machanical Engineering is preferable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Development Plan</h2>
<p>As of right now, the only skills I have is a hardly passable knowlege of HTML and Javascript. That having been said, I spend the majority of my time listening to programming courses in the background to develop my base knowledge. In order to broaden my skill set, it is my goal that by the end of my degree that I will be certified in Python, Java, Kotlin and Spring Boot. This is far from all the knowledge I'll need to attain this role. However feel as though on the job experience in other roles is also pivotal in developing a solid knowledge base.</p></p>
